title: I Will Miss This
draft: true
---

Here's
  a thought:
  I find the PhD
  to be fun,
  and suspect, even,
  that I will miss this time,
  intellectually,
  more than any time in my life.
I get to hang out
  with people,
  learn new things,
  with minimal responsibilities
  beyond the ones I want.
Now,
  I'm really lucky:
  I go to a high-visibility school
  and have advisors
  who can fund me consistently
  without worry.
