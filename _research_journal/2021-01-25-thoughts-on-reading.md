My advisor, Zach,
  likes to say
  that you shouldn't read papers
  when you begin working on a project.
His reasoning
  is that
  if you focus on what other people are doing
  you'll get distracted from the thing you're building;
  you'll worry too much
  about making sure it's unique.
Sometimes---well,
  all the time---there
  is
  high value
  in the action of building something
  even if it's already been built before.
At the *very* least,
  you'll understand it
  as thoroughly
  as anyone ever has.
More likely than not,
  you'll do something
  interestingly different
  in your implementation.

However, I really don't need encouragement
  to *not* read,
  because, well, I already barely do.
These thoughts
  are moreso
  about pushing yourself
  through the *fear* of reading.
I feel that fear
  frequently,
  for a number of identifiable reasons
  (and many, I'm sure, that I can't identify):

- I despair in the thought that there's too much to read, and so, why even bother starting. Well, in the niche field I'm in, that's definitely not true---I could fairly easily catch myself up with the most important papers.
- I also fear that someone will have done what I want to do---what Zach warns against. I believe that, for me, I should attack that possibility head-on. I would rather know upfront, and consciously focus on not letting it affect my exploration.
