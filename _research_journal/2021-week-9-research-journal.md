A core research idea
  coming from my work
  so far
  is that
  data movement/data access patterns
  should be first-class citizens,
  at least in machine learning.
Often,
  how you orchestrate the data
  is more important for performance
  than how you compute over it.
This applies
  at every scale, from
  the system-level concern
  of
  transferring between main memory
  and GPU memory, to
  the accelerator design concern
  of
  how you feed a systolic array.

I didn't
  do well on my goals,
  but certainly
  worked hard.
I finally
   let myself
   put some time
   into
   making a web demo
   for Glenside,
   which is live
   (though not actually doing anything)
   [here.](https://gussmith23.github.io/glenside-web-demo)
This was a guilty pleasure;
  at least, that's what I was
  telling myself.
I *wanted* to do it,
  so I didn't let myself do it.
I do this frequently;
  I tell myself
  the thing I want
  is not the thing I should do.
There are points
  when that's true,
  certainly,
  but I think
  I take it too far
  sometimes.
