I'm a PhD student at
  the University of Washington's
  Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering
  in Seattle,
  working with [Luis Ceze]({{ site.data.references.luis }}){:target='_blank'}
  and [Zach Tatlock]({{ site.data.references.zach}} ){:target='_blank'}.
My goal is to help architects craft
  new, wacky, nontraditional
  architectures---and to help everyone else program them---by
  building the next generation of
  hardware design tools, programming languages, and compilers.
I see
  computer architecture and programming languages
  as two sides of the same coin,
  and my research seeks to bridge the gap
  between the fields.
(If you're an undergrad/master's student
  looking for a project and this resonates with you,
  check out [this page](/potential-mentee-projects)!)

I'm currently working on
  [Glenside](https://github.com/gussmith23/glenside),
  a tool for simultaneously designing
  hardware and software
  for accelerating deep learning workloads.
Glenside represents hardware and software
  together in a single language;
  rewrites over this language
  change the hardware--software split.
We use this representation
  to explore the massive hardware--software design space.


Previously, I worked on
  [bringing custom datatype support](https://github.com/gussmith23/tvm/commit/cfefc6d394bc73c1d3f9b61445bfabb44cb2d291)
  into the [TVM stack](https://tvm.ai/)
  via my "Bring Your Own Datatypes" framework.

I've had many great internships in industry, 
  and I'm always looking for more!
In the summer of 2019,
  I worked with Marco Heddes on
  [static analysis of TVM/Relay programs](https://github.com/microsoft/Analysis-Framework-for-TVM)
  as part of Azure's AI and Advanced Architectures team.
I've also interned a bunch at Google:
  [implementing the Bluetooth protocol RFCOMM](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/85cd568e67d8113f3206af9af9060764abef7f35)
  for Fuchsia
  with Marie Janssen,
  [improving the Chrome Remote Desktop experience on Raspberry Pis](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/d18e0892dcabb921e226354f0c50c95a8b15f4b1)
  with Scott Nichols,
  and working with Mona El Mahdy on 
  [profiling Android apps.](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/efff78f6cf0930f9d2949ac75007ea52ac983db8)

In my free time,
  I [write](/writing) fiction and poetry,
  [program](https://github.com/gussmith23),
  climb, surf, run, 
  and just generally [try to enjoy life in and around Seattle](/pictures).
