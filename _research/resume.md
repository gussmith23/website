Education
{: .resume-heading}

[University of Washington](https://uw.edu){:target="_blank"}
{: .resume-subheading}
Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering
{: .resume-subtitle}

Pursuing Ph.D. since fall of 2018. Advised by [Luis Ceze]({{ site.data.references.luis }}){:target='_blank'} and [Zach Tatlock]({{ site.data.references.zach}} ){:target='_blank'}. I work at the intersection of computer architecture and programming languages, exploring how we can use concepts from programming languages to make hardware design easier and the software/hardware boundary more seamless.

{: .resume-subheading}
The Schreyer Honor's College
{: .resume-subtitle}

Graduated with combined M.S./B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering in spring of 2018. Advised by [Vijaykrishnan Narayanan](https://vijay565.wixsite.com/vijay){:target="_blank"} and [John Sampson](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~jms1257/){:target="_blank"}.

Research Projects

[Glenside]({{site.data.references.glenside}}){:target="_blank"}
{: .resume-subheading}
UW SAMPL Lab/[Real-time Machine Learning](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-03-21){:target='_blank'} 
{: .resume-subtitle}

Since the start of 2020,
  I have been working on software–hardware codesign 
  for machine learning accelerators.
My goal is to explore what happens
  when we treat hardware and compiler design
  as a program rewriting problem,
  allowing us to explore
  software and hardware transformations
  simultaneously.
See
  [the project's GitHub page]({{site.data.references.glenside}}){:target="_blank"}
  for more information.

[Bring Your Own Datatypes]({{site.data.references.bring-your-own-datatypes-blog-post}}){:target="_blank"}
{: .resume-subheading}
UW SAMPL Lab
{: .resume-subtitle}

From 2018–2020, I worked on a project enabling the exploration of new, nontraditional datatypes (i.e., alternatives to IEEE 754 floating point) in [TVM](https://tvm.ai){:target="_blank"}, a deep learning compiler. I presented this work for my qualifying project presentation at UW in the winter of 2020.

[CSE 512 19sp](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/19sp/){:target='_blank'} (Data Viz with Jeff Heer) Final Project
{: .resume-subtitle}

In this final project, we visualized the posit datatype, aiming to convey how posits spread themselves through the space of real numbers. This was completed as a final project for Jeff Heer's Data Visualization course in 19sp at the University of Washington. The project was inspired by my work in the datatypes space, and was completed with some of my architecture colleagues in my cohort.

[Static Analysis for Processing in Memory Accelerator Design](https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/5137hfs5022){:target="_blank"}
{: .resume-subheading}
PSU Microsystems Design Lab
{: .resume-subtitle}

Completed as my Master's thesis at Penn State. Given a model of accelerating computation using Processing in Memory, I used LLVM to statically analyze workloads and detect potentially offloadable code sections.
