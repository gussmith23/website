Somewhere,
  there's a recording
  of the following conversation:

Person 1: You're gonna hate to hear thisâ€“

Person 2: Lay it on me. It's not like the other stuff wasn't *[indistinguishable].*

*[Subdued laughter.
  A metal chair slides
    on a concrete floor,
    and a third voice
    says something
    away from the mic.
  The sound echoes
    in the hollow room.]*

Person 1: Yeah.
Anyway,
  there's a few parts to this.
First, God *was* in the ocean.

*[Brief silence.]*

Person 2: Okay.

Person 1:
It was in the ocean,
  but
  from what we can tell,
  it went to the moon.

*[Again, off mic,
  we hear the echoey sounds
  of a third person's voice.]*

Person 1: Yeah. *Fled.*
  *Fled* to the moon.
  But something else
  killed it
  before we got there.

*[Silence.]*

Person 2:
  ...and let me guess---no
  questions from me
  at this time?

Person 1: Sorry.
