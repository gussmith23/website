Configurable logic block guide
  for 7-series Xilinx FPGAs:
  <https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug474_7Series_CLB.pdf>.

There are a number of
  different types
  of slices,
  but the types we really need
  to care about
  are SLICEM/SLICEL and DSP.
The goal is,
  can we encode
  one of these slices
  in Rosette?
