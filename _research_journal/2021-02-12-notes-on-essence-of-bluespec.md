title: Notes on "The Essence of Bluespec" by Borgeaut et. al.
---

Bluespec is good,
  but cost modeling
  for Bluespec
  is hard
  because of user-supplied hints
  and opaque static analysis.
What's new!
Sounds like HLS!

This paper
  presents Koika,
  which keeps the desirable properties
  of Bluespec,
  but gives control
  over scheduling,
  which determines performance.

(I didn't get very far with this, apparently...that's the end of my notes!)
