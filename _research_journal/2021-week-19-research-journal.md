## What Am I Writing?

I'm reading *Bidirectional Typing* by Dunfield and Krishnaswami.
In the intro, they mention that
  the concept of
  bidirectional typing
  was referred to as
  "folklore"
  in the past.
That's how I feel
  about software--hardware
  codesign!
It's folklore.
There's HLS,
  which purports to be
  software--hardware codesign,
  but it's really
  just another hardware language.
