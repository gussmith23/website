## Goals

I have a few goals lingering:

1. Blog-ify LATTE thoughts
1. Make project proposal for UCSB people

Other than that,
  I have
  these goals:

1. I think Arxiv draft should actually be done by this week, if I don't plan to work on the weekend. I think this is doable; I have a "case studies" section I'm writing right now, and then I need an intro and a related work section, and then it's probably good.
2. I want to get BYOC working for at least the dense layers, for the RTML project.

## Goal Recap

Regarding
  the Arxiv draft:
  I didn't *finish* it this week,
  though my internal deadline
  was the end of the month
  (i.e. in three days).
I'm on track
  to have a skeleton
  of the technical content
  done
  and ready to read.
I need an intro
  (hard)
  and a related work section
  (easier).
The intro
  is something
  I need external help with,
  while the related work
  I can do myself.

I got BYOC up and running
  (ish),
  and need to package it up
  into our new
  [shared repository](https://github.com/uwsampa/rtml){:data-proofer-ignore="true"}.
So I'll call that one
  mostly done.

I'm still
  spending a lot of my time
  on the Glenside web demo,
  because, well, it's fun.
