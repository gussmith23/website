**Short version:**
Architecture PhD student interested in applying knowledge in programming languages to wacky, nontraditional, heterogeneous architectures.
School's website is [`cs.washington.edu`](https://cs.washington.edu), and I am `gussmith` at this address.

**Longer version:** I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering in Seattle. My advisors are [Luis Ceze]({{ site.data.references.luis }}){:target='_blank'} and [Zach Tatlock]({{ site.data.references.zach}} ){:target='_blank'}.

I am currently working on [bringing custom datatype support](https://github.com/gussmith23/tvm/commit/cfefc6d394bc73c1d3f9b61445bfabb44cb2d291) into the [TVM stack](https://tvm.ai/).
Generally, my research interests lie in the domains of computer architecture and programming languages. 
I am especially fascinated with exploring how to make programming even easier, even as the underlying architectures get more complex.
I am looking for internships for 2019 and beyond. 
I love working on software, especially in languages and on platforms I know nothing about. 
In Summer 2018, I completed an internship at Google in San Francisco, [implementing the Bluetooth protocol RFCOMM](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/85cd568e67d8113f3206af9af9060764abef7f35/drivers/bluetooth/lib/rfcomm/) for Google's new OS, [Fuchsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia). 
I have modern C++ experience (from personal projects, from my work on Fuchsia, and [from my work as a developer on Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/d18e0892dcabb921e226354f0c50c95a8b15f4b1)), solid C and Linux experience through coursework, and some professional Java experience working on both the open-source [Android](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/efff78f6cf0930f9d2949ac75007ea52ac983db8) tree and internal tools at Google.
