## Always Be Writing Something

I just finished
  my first deadline push,
  and having done so,
  I can say I benefitted immensely
  from the fact that
  I forced myself to write
  daily
  semi-consistently
  over the past year.
With all said and done,
  I only wish
  I had written more frequently!
Or perhaps
  focused on different things
  (e.g. writing the
    first draft of
    the evaluation section
    or making
    the first draft of the
    figures---things
    that take serious mental effort
    and that you don't want to do
    close to the deadline).

My suggestion
  to myself
  is to *always be writing,*
  and more specifically,
  always be writing *something.*
Know what your target is
  and work a little on it every day.
Even if it's far off.
*Especially* if it's far off!
Even if it seems unimportant,
  like writing a blog post.

Consistent productivity
  sounds like a chore,
  sounds like a thing of discipline,
  but it's very freeing.
It does take discipline,
  of course.
But in the end,
  25 minutes a day (which is what I do)
  is nothing,
  and often leaves me wanting more,
  but when I lay down to sleep
  I feel like I've done *something.*

## Reflection on Goals

This week
  also slipped by,
  eaten up by a DARPA video
  I had to make,
  among other things.
Hopefully this won't keep happening.
