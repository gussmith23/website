Winter mornings
  like nights,
  and nights
  like mornings.

Concrete paths iced up
  and I wonder
  at how much the university
  must spend
  on sidewalks alone.
My summer brain
  makes space
  for thoughts
  about how they must choose
  where to lay the next sidewalk,
  or put up the next fence;
  how they must watch the grass
  slowly be trampled,
  as the flow of students bends and oxbows,
  semester to semester;
  how the grass of the quads
  gets torn up,
  the dirt packed hard.
But at 7am
  on a no's-day
  in the cold black winter morning
  I am only conscious enough
  to be thankful for the salt under
  my foot
  in the instant I feel it underfoot,
  and then,
  even that thought
  disappears.


Winter nights
  we come alive,
  and so do they.
We,
  out from our classes,
  our labs,
  into the snow,
  towards home.
They, out of garages
  on the far side of campus,
  where nothing happens
  and nobody sleeps.
Us,
  to heat and sound
  and life.
Bars are 
  open---have been open---and
  we file in and out.
They,
  after our ghosts,
  along the pathways
  looping back on themselves.
