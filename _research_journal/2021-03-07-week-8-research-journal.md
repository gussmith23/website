## Goals

Goals for this week, as written, are

1. Go hard on Arxiv (what does it mean?)
2. Make a final push for LATTE
3. Finish [Python notebook](https://github.com/gussmith23/rtml-notebooks) (notebook is private) (see output [here](https://gussmith23.github.io/rtml-notebooks)) for the RTML demo. Namely, (get generated C code working)

I just wrote this bit
  for a Google application;
  I thought I should
  log it here:

> My focus is in making the accelerator design process accessible. I believe that hardware---especially accelerators---are hardware manifestations of the software workloads that run on them, with a heavy serving of institutional architectural knowledge (e.g. how a computation should be optimally pipelined; how to design the network; how to set up the memory hierarchy). Copying the process of software compilation, I believe it should be possible to progressively lower a workload or set of workloads to an accelerator design, using lowering steps which encode institutional architectural knowledge and information about the target hardware platform.

  I also worked
  the whole day
  on Arxiv.

## Reflection on Goals

I certainly
  put a lot of time
  into Arxiv.
That's going fine!

I made a final push
  for LATTE,
  but didn't make it.
I need to turn
  those thoughts
  into a blog post.

I also finished up
  the codegen
  for the notebook.
