Two people in a small community
  pass each other on a run.
They meet
  at the top of their respective loops;
  in truth,
  they are on the same loop,
  but in opposite directions.
They wave and smile
  without thinking.
On the way back,
  one of them imagines all possible routes
  which would cause them to pass each other again.
They are,
  in fact,
  close to neighbors;
  they both live on the bottommost street
  of the neighborhood,
  separated by only two houses.
And so he was thinking...he was thinking,
  if they only passed each other at the top of their loops,
  they must have started moving away from each others’ houses,
  and not towards;
  but in his head,
  he could find
  no combination of paths
  which resulted in them passing again.

He was still thinking about it
  as he stretched on his porch,
  the light of the day giving no indication to morning,
  noon, or evening,
  when his neighbor once again passed on the dirt road
  in front of his house.
They didn’t wave this time.
