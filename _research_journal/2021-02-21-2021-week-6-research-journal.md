## Goals

1. **Some amount of progress on Arxiv.** Again, totally unsure on how to track progress. I write an hour a day. I could up it to two. I worry that, without a goal, I'm not being efficient. But honestly, it's going well, so why break my back over it?
2. **Finish a LATTE draft.**

## Reflecting on Goals

Yikes,
  I was bad this week.
I actually did a bunch of work,
  but was bad about journaling.

Both papers
  are behind
  and not moving
  how I want them to.
I'm not hitting my goal
  of doing an hour on both
  a day.
I need to just
  grind out the LATTE paper.
