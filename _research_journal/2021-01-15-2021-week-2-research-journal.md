title: "2021 Week 2 Research Journal" 
---

A few things I want to write about at some point:
- Why am I writing this journal?
- The familiar "what am I doing here" feeling
- Disagreeing with mentors/coworkers, or, having differing levels of excitement about a path forward
- Reading papers
- Feeling time pressure is mostly counterproductive in a PhD, and you should take advantage of that fact
