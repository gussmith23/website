I miss 
  the summer nights.
The sound of crickets
  in the warm air.
Coming across the field
  after a night swim.
Did sound
  carry differently
  through the summer night air?
Closed in the field.
Heavy and warm
  like a blanket.
The field was a window
  and we walked under it.
Did we know then?
Did we look?

Later,
  watching reality TV
  with your mom
  while everyone slept.

Even later,
  we drive through 
  an empty Kansas,
  full of people.
Space
  was inches off the ground.
We saw thousands of miles.
