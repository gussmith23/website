- **April 2021:** Our paper, ["Pure Tensor Program Rewriting via Access Patterns",](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09377)
    was accepted at [MAPS@PLDI21!](https://pldi21.sigplan.org/home/maps-2021)
  This is the result of this past year's work on
    [Glenside.](https://github.com/gussmith23/glenside)


- **March 2021:**
  Long time without updating!
  This summer
    I'll be interning
    with [Aart Bik](https://www.aartbik.com/)
    at Google,
    working on bringing
    sparse tensor support
    to MLIR.

- **Summer 2020–Winter 2021**:
  I've been working on
    [Glenside](https://github.com/gussmith23/glenside),
    a new language
    for representing tensor-based
    hardware–software
    programs.

- **May 2020:**
  I wrote a [blog post]({{site.data.references.bring-your-own-datatypes-blog-post}}){:target='_blank'}
    about my work on the [Bring Your Own Datatypes]({% link _research/bring-your-own-datatypes.md %})
    framework.
  It is a good overview of what the framework does,
    for those who are already (even vaguely) familiar with TVM.
  (Update, September 2020: [Andrew]({{site.data.references.andrew}}){:target='_blank'}
    updated the blog post
    with the work he's done
    on the framework)

- **May 2020:**
  I gave a talk for [PLSE]({{site.data.references.plse}}){:target='_blank'}
    about my new project, Glenside.
  I also delivered a very similar talk for the Cornell Architecture and PL groups,
    as part of a series of talks
    organized by [Rachit Nigam]({{site.data.references.rachit}}){:target='_blank'}.

- **February 2020:** My first acceptance!
  My submission,
  ["Enumerating Hardware-Software Splits with Program Rewriting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00290),
  was accepted to the Young Architects Workshop at ASPLOS2020.
  The 2-page paper describes my upcoming work.
  (Due to the COVID-19 situation, ASPLOS2020 was canceled.)

- **February 2020:** I completed my quals exam!
  + [Post-quals smiles :)](/assets/2020-02-24-quals-talk/post-quals.jpg){:target='_blank'}
  + [My slides](/assets/2020-02-24-quals-talk/2020-02-24-quals-talk-with-notes.pdf){:target='_blank'}
    ([without notes](/assets/2020-02-24-quals-talk/2020-02-24-quals-talk-without-notes.pdf){:target='_blank'},
    keynote file too large to upload)
- **January 2020:** I also started off this quarter by presenting on the [MLPerf Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02549){:target='_blank'} paper at a [SAMPL]({{site.data.references.sampl}}){:target='_blank'} meeting.
- **January 2020:** Happy New Year!! I started off the new year (and new quarter) by giving my first whiteboard talk.
                    I talked about RTML, the new DARPA project which we are working on.
                    I laid out some of my early ideas so that I could get early-stage feedback.
                    The whiteboard talk was also meant to encourage similar, more casual talks in the lab, rather than the formal talks we may feel expected to deliver.
  + The images of the whiteboard (in order) are here:

- **December 2019:** My lab, [SAMPL]({{site.data.references.sampl}}){:target='_blank'}, gave series of talks at the [Allen School Colloquium](https://www.cs.washington.edu/events/colloquia){:target='_blank'}. I delivered a new talk which I titled _The Datatypes Zoo,_ about the wild world of datatypes which I've been introduced to over the past year.

- **November 2019:** I'm happy to say I'm now coadvised by [Zach Tatlock]({{ site.data.references.zach }}){:target='_blank'}! I hope to work with Zach and Luis together to explore how we can use programming languages and compilers to improve the hardware design process.
- **November 2019:** I presented a poster at the University of Virginia on my datatypes work at the annual review for the [CRISP center]({{ site.data.references.crisp }}){:target='_blank'}, from whom I get my funding.
  + [My poster]({% link assets/2019-11-05-crisp-bring-your-own-datatypes-poster.pdf %})
- **October 2019:** I helped out the [Relay]({{ site.data.references.relay }}){:target='_blank'} group with a hackathon for the [ADA center]({{ site.data.references.ada }}){:target='_blank'} meeting in Ann Arbor.
* **Summer 2019:** I completed an internship as a research intern with the Azure Hardware Systems Group under Marco Heddes. I was using TVM to statically analyze deep learning workloads. 
  + [The static analysis framework](https://github.com/microsoft/Analysis-Framework-for-TVM){:target='_blank'}, which Microsoft was kind enough to open-source.

- **June 2019:** I gave a talk at ISCA/FCRC in Phoenix as part of our [TVM]({{ site.data.references.tvm }}){:target='_blank'} tutorial. Here are some materials:
