- **February 2020:** My first acceptance!
  My submission,
  ["Enumerating Hardware-Software Splits with Program Rewriting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00290),
  was accepted to the Young Architects Workshop at ASPLOS2020.
  The 2-page paper describes my upcoming work.
  Due to the COVID-19 situation, ASPLOS2020 was canceled, which is a bummer.
  Still proud of the acceptance!

- **February 2020:** I completed my quals exam!

- **January 2020:** I also started off this quarter by presenting on the [MLPerf Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02549){:target='_blank'} paper at a [SAMPL]({{site.data.references.sampl}}){:target='_blank'} meeting.
- **January 2020:** Happy New Year!! I started off the new year (and new quarter) by giving my first whiteboard talk.
                    I talked about RTML, the new DARPA project which we are working on.
                    I laid out some of my early ideas so that I could get early-stage feedback.
                    The whiteboard talk was also meant to encourage similar, more casual talks in the lab, rather than the formal talks we may feel expected to deliver.
  + The images of the whiteboard (in order) are here:

- **December 2019:** My lab, [SAMPL]({{site.data.references.sampl}}){:target='_blank'}, gave series of talks at the [Allen School Colloquium](https://www.cs.washington.edu/events/colloquia){:target='_blank'}. I delivered a new talk which I titled _The Datatypes Zoo,_ about the wild world of datatypes which I've been introduced to over the past year.

- **December 2019:** I gave a talk on Relay program analysis at this year's [TVM conference]({{site.data.references.tvmconf2019}}){:target='_blank'}.
  + [My slides](assets/2019-12-06-tvmconf-lightning-talk-program-analysis/2019-12-06-tvmconf-lightning-talk-program-analysis-with-notes.pdf){:target='_blank'} ([without notes](assets/2019-12-06-tvmconf-lightning-talk-program-analysis/2019-12-06-tvmconf-lightning-talk-program-analysis-without-notes.pdf){:target='_blank'}, [keynote file](assets/2019-12-06-tvmconf-lightning-talk-program-analysis/2019-12-06-tvmconf-lightning-talk-program-analysis.key){:target='_blank'})
- **November 2019:** I presented to my research group, [SAMPL]({{site.data.references.sampl}}){:target='_blank'}, about my summer internship at Microsoft, where I developed a program analysis framework in [Relay]({{site.data.references.relay}}){:target='_blank'}. Look out for my lightning talk at this year's [TVM conference]({{site.data.references.tvmconf2019}}){:target='_blank'} where I'll also be talking about program analysis in Relay.

- **November 2019:** I'm happy to say I'm now coadvised by [Zach Tatlock]({{ site.data.references.zach }}){:target='_blank'}! I hope to work with Zach and Luis together to explore how we can use programming languages and compilers to improve the hardware design process.
- **November 2019:** I presented a poster at the University of Virginia on my datatypes work at the annual review for the [CRISP center]({{ site.data.references.crisp }}){:target='_blank'}, from whom I get my funding.
  + [My poster](assets/2019-11-05-crisp-bring-your-own-datatypes-poster.pdf){:target='_blank'}
- **October 2019:** I helped out the [Relay]({{ site.data.references.relay }}){:target='_blank'} group with a hackathon for the [ADA center]({{ site.data.references.ada }}){:target='_blank'} meeting in Ann Arbor.
* **Summer 2019:** I completed an internship as a research intern with the Azure Hardware Systems Group under Marco Heddes. I was using TVM to statically analyze deep learning workloads. 
  + [The static analysis framework](https://github.com/microsoft/Analysis-Framework-for-TVM){:target='_blank'}, which Microsoft was kind enough to open-source.
- **June 2019:** I gave a talk at ISCA/FCRC in Phoenix as part of our [TVM]({{ site.data.references.tvm }}){:target='_blank'} tutorial. Here are some materials:
  + [A clip of my talk](https://youtu.be/MxhQN7OEU7E){:target='_blank'}
