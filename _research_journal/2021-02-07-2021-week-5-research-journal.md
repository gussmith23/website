## Goals

My goals this week
  are

1. **"Finish" the Glenside arxiv draft.** Tentatively I think this means re-drafting the intro and figuring out whether I need an overview. There'll still be much to be done, but I want to get the paper out.
2. **Begin my [LATTE](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/latte21) draft.**
3. **Read MAESTRO paper.** Related to multiple systolic arrays.

I have
  a bunch
  of threads
  running right now.

- Writing a paper about Glenside to put on arxiv.
  - Related: looking into Glenside as a tool for tensor layout exploration.
- Planning a submission to [LATTE](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/latte21).
- Trying to understand how multiple systolic arrays work together, and when they make sense.
  - Eyeriss, MAESTRO, PhD thesis from the Stanford

Some of my time
  (probably a good amount)
  will be taken up
  by internship interview practice, too.

I also had a great meeting with
  [Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/),
  [Deeksha Dangwal](https://www.deekshadangwal.com/),
  and Chris Zhang
  from UCSB's [ArchLab](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/).
Jon had seen a tweet
  of mine
  from a few months ago
  and reached out,
  as we have similar research interests.

We specifically talked about
  (note that this is through
    my lens!)
  ways to evaluate designs
  without expensive things
  like full RTL simulation.
Perhaps more generally,
  we talked about
  architectural modeling,
  and what options exist
  beyond expensive
  cycle-accurate
  simulation.
Deeksha's paper,
  [Trace Wringing for Program Trace Privacy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9060817),
  had specifically
  been on his mind;
  he thinks that heatmaps
  are a good example
  of ways to boil down
  workloads
  into a "lower dimensional"
  space.

## Reflection on Goals

Glenside draft is not finished,
  though I did get a bunch of work done
  on it.
I don't know
  how to pace myself
  when writing a paper;
  in fact,
  I'm not sure
  how to set goals
  with most things.
There's the Eisenhower quote
  that Zach loves:

> Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.

In some sense,
  the act of planning out my week
  is the good thing;
  hitting the goals
  at the end of the week
  shouldn't be seen
  as a necessity.
Still,
  it'd be useful
  to be able to predict
  when I might be done
  with something,
  working at a normal pace.

I did begin the LATTE draft,
  and have some good feelings about it.
Tangentially related,
  I've been having
  great discussions with Luis
  the past few meetings.
It took me a while
  to feel comfortable
  having research conversations
  with him,
  or with anyone;
  perhaps it just took me a while
  to feel like I knew
  enough
  to speak,
  or to feel like
  I knew enough
  to know I'll never
  know enough,
  but
  never will anyone else.

Did not
  read the MAESTRO
  paper.
That task
  got swallowed up
  when I needed to study
  for an internship interview.
Will do that next week.
It's lower priority anyway.
