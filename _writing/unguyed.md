Only once in the past two weeks
  have I heard someone remark that,
  for spring,
  it feels
  an awful lot
  like fall.
Bright, cloudless skies
  have long melted the snow,
  but throughout the mornings
  it remains below freezing.
From dawn til midday,
  every person
  is attuned
  to the warming
  of the great cold mass we live in;
  everyone feels the warmth spread
  from their core, to their arms, legs, to their faces,
  to the tips of their ears
  and nose and to the tips of their fingers and toes,
  and then outward,
  to the wooden floors of their houses and to those houses’ stone foundations,
  to the copper of their pipes,
  to the asphalt of our streets,
  and then up---up and outward,
  through the concrete of our town,
  towards the sky.
No one wonders 
  where the heat goes
  when it leaves our town
  each night.

It’s a weekday,
  and I’m driving home.
It’s just warm enough
  to have the car window down.
They say it was a day like today,
  some time ago,
  when everyone returned home
  to find their plates,
  their glasses,
  anything in open cabinets, 
  smashed on the floor.
People returned home
  to find their neighbors in their lawns,
  discussing, consulting.
People returned home
  to find their neighbors
  knocking on the doors
  of the only family on the street
  who wasn’t outside,
  throwing a minor fit of panic,
  trying to find out why exactly they weren’t panicking.

They weren’t panicking
  because it was on a day like today
  that the spouses of the municipal construction crew
  knew to stay home,
  to put their plates on the carpet,
  to hold the cabinets closed.

On the mountain
  above my town
  stand the radio masts.
You can see them
  from anywhere in town,
  especially at night.
On a day like today,
  that long ago,
  you’d still see them.
There’d be less of them,
  probably,
  but you’d still see them.
And on a day like today,
  that long ago,
  you’d see one more than you’d have seen the day before.

I was fixated
  with the broadcast towers
  of [Penobscot Knob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penobscot_Knob)
  when I lived in Mountain Top.
This story
  was meant to
  center on
  a fictional event
  involving the installation
  of a new tower,
  on a similar hill
  outside a similar town.
Specifically,
  an "unguyed" tower---one
  that didn't have
  cables (or "guys")
  stabilizing it.
Small
  unguyed towers
  exist,
  but an unguyed tower
  of this size
  is absurd.
The idea
  was that they were going to bury it
  deep into the ground;
  more specifically,
  they were going to *drop* it
  into the ground,
  causing a minor seismic event.

Reading it now,
  I clearly also meant to capture
  the beautiful, cold, bluebird days
  of a NEPA spring;
  days
  that pair so oddly
  with the feelings
  of living in a place
  where nothing interesting happens.
