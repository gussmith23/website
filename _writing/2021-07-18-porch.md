title: Summer Evenings Sketch
---

Sunday evenings in summer;
  blues coming in
  over the speakers;
  sun hanging at the perfect golden angle.

These were moments
  I never remember ending.
Fear could have made me
  count every last Sunday,
  count down the minutes to sundown,
  as I count down
  the twenty minutes before last call
  on a particularly frantic night,
  or the last days of a vacation with friends.
Yet I know
  there'll always be more of these.
There will be more than I know what to do with.
And if I'm lucky,
  they'll even be filled
  with people I love.
