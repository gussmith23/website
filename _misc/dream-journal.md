I have a lot of funny dreams that I'd like to share.

- **March 6th/7th, 2020:** I had a dream I met a black parrot. It was friendly
  and made me laugh. I'm hoping this is a good sign for my final project in 
  Michael Taylor's VLSI class, where we're working on the 
  [Black Parrot core](https://github.com/black-parrot/black-parrot). Also odd
  that I've had two bird-related dreams in the past few weeks. These are the
  only bird dreams I've had, to my memory.

- **Sometime in February, 2020:** I had a dream I was sitting in the
  [PLSE lab](https://uwplse.org) and a white bird (a cockatoo maybe?) landed on 
  my shoulder. It whispered nice things into my ears and just generally made me 
  feel warm and fuzzy inside. This was especially nice at the time, given that I
  was very stressed about my qualifying exams!
